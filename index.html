                        <p>I knew she was weak, I had never seen her in a state like this before. From the moment I opened the door I knew there was no escape, my mind was paralyzed, there was no hope left, and all we could do was pray for a miracle. Her soul was as pure as nature, she herself was a miracle.</p>
                        <p>She was meant to die and perish poorly, yet there she was, lying on her bed with a perfect little smile written all over her face...</p>
