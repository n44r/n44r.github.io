                    <p>I knew she was weak, I had never seen her in a state like this before. From the moment I opened the door I knew there was no escape, my mind was paralyzed, there was no hope left, and all we could do was pray for a miracle. Her soul was as pure as nature, she herself was a miracle.</p>
                    
                    <p>She was meant to die and perish poorly, yet there she was, lying on her bed with a perfect little smile written all over her face. She was the reincarnation of beauty. I sat at her feet and began to listen. In front of her I was just a disciple, I shed a tear with every word she spoke. The more she spoke the more peace I felt inside my heart. It was impossible for me to believe that she was a normal human being. Miracles aren't always supposed to be something superstitious, a miracle is that thing that opens your consciousness. She was my miracle.</p>
                    
                    <p>She took my hands and looked me in the eyes. I could barely see her through the tears, I knew the end was near. She said that she had to leave, she promised she would come back. I told her that she was lying, that she would not come back and that I would never see her again. She only kept smiling.</p>
                    
                    <p>Years later I realized that she never left, that she had not lied. I could feel her presence through all these years. She was and always will be an inspiration. A miracle can never die.</p>
