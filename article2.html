                    <p>"Will you still be the same the next time I see you ?!" That was the last thing she said, with a sad smile on her face while struggling to hide the tears as I was walking away. I couldn't say much, it wasn't that I had nothing to say, but I just wanted to look at her face one last time. I tried to memorize every single detail, the red cheeks, her thin lips, the blonde curly hair, and I remember exactly every single detail, except for one thing: her eyes. I never had the courage to look into her eyes. I didn't and I never will. How could a sinner like me look an angel in the eyes when he had already committed the sin of falling in love with one?</p>
                    
                    <p>When God punished Adam and Eve, He took heaven and immortality from them and placed them on earth. That was when it all began, the cycle of birth and death, darkness and light, love and hate, being together and being apart. I was just a sinner, condemned to spend the rest of his life between despair and hope, the hope of you coming back from the dead.</p>
